Таким образом, ваше предложение закодировано вектором, длина которого равна длине словаря. Недостатков у этого метода только два: получающийся вектор имеет очень большую длину, и к тому же он сильно разряжен (в нем много нулей, так как одно предложение априори не может содержать всех слов), из-за чего с ним трудно работать. Второй недостаток - мы просто смотрим на сам _факт наличия_ слова в предложении, но не на _контекст_ этого слова.\n","\n","Оба этих недостатка успешно забарывают методы, основанные на **распределенной семантике**, такие как легендарный Word2Vec и известный GloVe.

Introduction\n","The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\n","sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\n","vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\n","\n","However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\n","people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\n","square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\n","fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type\n","spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\n","idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\n","\n","2.Design\n","Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\n","tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\n","be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\n","methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\n","panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\n","\n","The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\n","Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\n","gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\n","communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\n","of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\n","the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\n","\n","3.Missions\n","The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\n","a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\n","groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\n","rate.\n","b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\n","areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\n","reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\n","sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\n","volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\n","locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\n","base, BTW]\n","c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\n","nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft\n","causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged\n","tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an\n","ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat\n","is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300\n","deg C.

I\n","would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\n","relevant books are listed in a companion article.\n","\n","To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\n","as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\n","questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\n","up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\n","frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\n","\n","Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\n","posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\n","questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\n","who proselytize on alt.atheism.\n","\n","So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\n","Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\n","being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\n","may not.\n","\n","\"What is atheism?\"\n","\n","Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\n","Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\n","often referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\n","atheism\".\n","\n","It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\n","atheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\n","atheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\n","fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\n","\n","Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\n","atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\n","flat-out denials.\n","\n","\"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\"\n","\n","Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\n","it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\n","believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\n","not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\n","\n","\"What is agnosticism then?\"\n","\n","The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\n","Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\n","disclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\n","must be some cause unknown and unknowable.\n","\n","Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\n","sure whether God exists.\n","\n","Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\n","you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact\n","that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\n","use agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\n","referring to \"strong atheism\".\n","\n","Beware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\n","is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\n","sure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't\n","the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\n","about the universe.\n","\n","\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\n","\n","There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\n","particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.\n","\n","Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\n","is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\n","such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\n","see no evidence that God exists.\n","\n","\"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\n","\n","There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\n","quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\n","all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\n","obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\n","well-defined is a matter for debate.\n","\n","However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\n","impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\n","God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\n","show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\n","\n","If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\n","question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\n","may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\n","might be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is\n","often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\n","primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.\n","\n","Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\n","unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\n","the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively\n","prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\n","\n","To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\n","tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\n","prove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\n","default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\n","\n","Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\n","exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\n","varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\n","may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\n","possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\n","book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\n","by any present-day religion exists.\n","\n","In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\n","close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\n","that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\n","God are not really applicable.\n","\n","\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\n","\n","If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\n","must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\n","detectable.\n","\n","If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\n","does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\n","that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\n","importance whether he exists or not.\n","\n","If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\n","Surely he should still be detectable today?\n","\n","Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\n","verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\n","effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\n","from all the other things that don't exist?\n","\n","\"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but\n"," isn't it still a religious belief?\"\n","\n","One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\n","redefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\n","\n","Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\n","that it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\n","statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\n","then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\n","it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\n","uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\n","redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\n","to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\n","\n","The point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn't\n","atheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\n","\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\n","controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\n","worship.\n","\n","[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\n","  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\n","\n","Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\n","categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\n","\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\n","human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\n","science, politics, and watching TV.\n","\n","\"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\n"," still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\n","\n","Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\n","actually believes in.\n","\n","Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\n","make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\n","try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\n","questioning if experience throws them into doubt.\n","\n","Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\n","assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\n","the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\n","\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\n","acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\n","\n","Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\n","According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\n","faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\n","religious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\n","general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\n","state with certainty that the universe exists.\n","\n","Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\n","Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\n","has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as\n","even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\n","the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\n","\n","\"If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?\"\n","\n","It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\n","\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\n","\n","Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\n","it can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\n","speak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\n","have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\n","\n","This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\n","Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\n","\n","Most atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\n","will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\n","course, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\n","many countries.\n","\n","A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\n","when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\n","impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\n","\n","(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\n","of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\n","worship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\n","Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\n","order to gain complete power over the population.)\n","\n","Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\n","religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\n","the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\n","church and state should remain separate.\n","\n","\"But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\n"," surely that's the same as state atheism?\"\n","\n","The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\n","not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\n","means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\n","another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\n","nature.\n","\n","Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\n","example, religious believers have historically been responsible for\n","encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\n","campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\n","religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\n","and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\n","are quite happy to see them have their say.\n","\n","\"What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people\n"," pray?\"\n","\n","Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\n","that those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\n","schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\n","need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\n","that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\n","acceptable to all those present at any public event.\n","\n","Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\n","to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\n","motives.\n","\n","\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\n"," atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't\n"," atheists object to the religious charities?\"\n","\n","There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\n","contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\n","the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\n","for charities founded on a theistic basis.\n","\n","Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in\n","connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\n","matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say\n","self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\n","of religious beliefs.\n","\n","To \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\n","rather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\n","birthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\n","\n","\"You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\n"," one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\n","\n","Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\n","force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\n","choose to call themselves atheists.\n","\n","It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\n","backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\n","other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\n","expectations of others.\n","\n","On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\n","backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\n","along with a group rather than act or think independently.\n","\n","\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\n","\n","They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.\n","\n","Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\n","Verdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\n","they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\n","Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\n","of the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\n","\n","Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\n","realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\n","appearance.\n","\n","\"Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?\"\n","\n","That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\n","atheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one\n","talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\n","(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\n","\n","Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\n","co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\n","atheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\n","of self-preservation.\n","\n","Many atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\n","feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\n","what happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.\n","\n","Naturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\n","atheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\n","behave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\n","actions.  For example:\n","\n","  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\n","   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\n","   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\n","   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\n","   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\n","   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\n","\n","The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\n","by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\n","Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\n","religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\n","\n","   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\n","   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\n","   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\n","   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\n","   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\n","   before salvation; 5% after.\n","                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\n","\n","So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\n","behaviour.\n","\n","\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\n","\n","If you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\n","answer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\n","which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\n","\n","If you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\n","is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\n","will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\n","but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\n","humans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather\n","than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\n","\n","\"Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\n","\n","A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\n","atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\n","them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\n","with what they observed around them.\n","\n","Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\n","unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\n","studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\n","made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\n","\n","This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\n","individual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\n","of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\n","choice that person can honestly make.\n","\n","\"But don't atheists want to believe in God?\"\n","\n","Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\n","of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\n","\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\n","\n","Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\n","one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\n","such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\n","believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\n","\n","\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\n"," unwilling in their souls to see!\"\n","\n","Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\n","above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\n","exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\n","\n","Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\n","all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\n","Comments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly\"\n","are likely to be viewed as patronizing.\n","\n","Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\n","vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\n","being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\n","willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\n","futile.\n","\n","\"Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\n","\n","Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\n","meaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\n","count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\n","people who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\n","political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\n","\n","It is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\n","events.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\n","that has a \"meaning\".\n","\n","To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\n","a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\n","meaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\n","coffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\n","\n","\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\n","\n","There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\n","Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\n","\n","That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\n","what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\n","should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\n","\n","In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\n","unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\n","it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\n","that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just\n","hard luck.\n","\n","\"Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\n","\n","The short answer is \"No, do you?\"\n","\n","Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\n","arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\n","found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\n","\n","Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of\n","the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\n","to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\n","\n","\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments\n"," apply?\"\n","\n","No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\n","the sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\n","is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\n","\n","Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\n","because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\n","but to everyone else.\n","\n","\"What sort of harm?\"\n","\n","Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not\n","just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\n","think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\n","Imagine how that effort could be better spent.\n","\n","Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\n","of ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\n","prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\n","because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\n","\n","It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and\n","condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\n","third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\n","\n","Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\n","allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\n","religion.\n","\n","\"Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\n"," sort of excuse.\"\n","\n","What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard\n","to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\n","convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\n","and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL\n","Christian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the\n","Catholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?\n","\n","In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\n","calls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\n","actions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\n","are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\n","the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be\n","much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have\n","made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\n","aren't a perversion of what your God intended?\n","\n","If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\n","should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\n","Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\n","others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\n","Christian.\n","\n","\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\n"," nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\n"," that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\n","\n","That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\n","positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\n","harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\n","don't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.\n","\n","It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\n","it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\n","would argue that asserting nothing is better still.\n","\n","\"Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?\"\n","\n","Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\n","it is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\n","graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\n","\n","Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\n","gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\n","people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\n","\n","Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\n","we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\n","there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\n","as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\n","purposes as well.\n","\n","\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\n"," something?\"\n","\n","Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's\n","worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\n","concept of God in the Christian sense.\n","\n","Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's\n","rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\n","\n","\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\n"," that God exists?\"\n","\n","For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\n","does not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\n","not determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\n","realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\n","same way that theists view their religious leaders.\n","\n","A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\n","when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\n","respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\n","subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\n","\n","\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\n"," nothing?\"\n","\n","Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\n","properties which have helped it so spread so far.\n","\n","The theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\n","themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\n","religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\n","encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\n","discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\n","to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\n","religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\n","other memes.\n","\n","Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\n","successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\n","the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\n","because of the number of people who have caught it.\n","\n","\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\n"," messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\n","\n","There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\n","few of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\n","religions.\n","\n","   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\n","\n","   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\n","\n","   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to\n","   find it.\n","\n","   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\n","\n","   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.\n","\n","   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\n","   yourself.\n","\n","   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.\n","\n","   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.\n","\n","   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.\n","\n","and finally (and most importantly):\n","\n","   All beliefs should be open to question.\n","\n","Thanks for taking the time to read this article.\n","\n","\n","mathew\n","\n","-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n","Version: 2.2\n","\n","iQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\n","7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\n","nihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\n","q0Z4hSSPpAU=\n","=q2V5\n","-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n","\n","I suppose these illegal guns have been found?

In\n","    general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three\n","    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent\n","    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these\n","    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to\n","    special 'servers'.\n","\n","    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of\n","    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.\n","\n","    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central\n","    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In\n","    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for\n","    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more\n","    specialized mailing lists described below.\n","\n","    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin\n","    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews\n","    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a\n","    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are\n","    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',\n","    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called\n","    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends\n","    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby\n","    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so\n","    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet\n","    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was\n","    posted.\n","\n","    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and\n","    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not\n","    accessible as mailing lists.

This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\n","section column.  \n","\n","A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\n","build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\n","as you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\n","load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\n","calculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\n","sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\n","below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \n","below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\n","\n","The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\n","to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\n","of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\n","to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\n","limit on area, although there will be practical limits based\n","on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\n","much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\n","a foundation that the bedrock can support.\n","\n","Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\n","cost.

Then we have a tower/payload mass\n","ratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\n","height becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\n","atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\n","have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\n","will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\n","rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\n","but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\n","they represent wasted thrust.

How about:  A prize for the first\n","non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\n","moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\n","lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.

Technical information\n","========================\n","\n","The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\n","The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\n","(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\n","coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\n","(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\n","algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\n","difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\n","algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\n","use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\n","dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\n","the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\n","\n","Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\n","+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\n","over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\n","is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\n","expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\n","\n","Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\n","somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\n","by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\n","constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\n","lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\n","to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\n","on NTSC).

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\n","demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\n","rocket ship.\n","\n","        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\n","Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\n","mid-June.\n","\n","        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\n","SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\n","million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a\n","follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\n","a sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\n","agencies.\n","\n","        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\n","orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\n","changes in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\n","less of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\n","a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\n","\n","        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\n","said Col.  Simon \"Pete\" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden\n","declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\n","program. \"I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\n","have available to spend,\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\n","Douglas Astronautics headquarters.\n","\n","        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital\n","objective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \"better,\n","faster, cheaper\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\n","this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \"leapfrog\" ahead of\n","evolutionary technology developments.\n","\n","        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \"build a little, test a\n","little\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\n","the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\n","showed how today's engineers could move beyond the \"miracles of our\n","parents' time.\"\n","\n","        \"The key is management,\" Worden said. \"SDIO had a very light hand\n","on this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\"\n","\n","        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\n","lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\n","crucial. \"It's essential we do not end up with a large management\n","structure where the price goes up exponentially.\"\n","\n","        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the\n","House Science, Space and Technology Committee. \"This is the direction\n","we're going to have to go,\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's\n","Democratic chairman. \"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't\n","sustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.\"\n","\n","        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.\n","Joking that \"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\"\n","Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\n","were left to the civil space agency.\n","\n","        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\n","Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\n","rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \"Let's not\n","build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!\"\n","\n","         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the\n","private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\n","\n","        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\n","C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\n","about a large private secotro commitment. \"On very large ventures,\n","companies put in seed money,\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'\n","senior vice president for space systems. \"You need strong government\n","investments.\"\n","\n","        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\n","for the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\n","development.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\n","Aircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\n","the DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\n","eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\n","\n","        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \"expand the envelope\"\n","of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\n","first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\n","take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\n","5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\n","feet.\n","\n","        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\n","tests will include a \"pitch-over\" manever that rotates the vehicle back\n","into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\n","\n","        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles \"Pete\"\n","Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\n","Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\n","aircraft-like approach to operations.

What are these\n","principles that SSRT defies?\n","\n","     Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\n","a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n","\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\n","violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\n","less than many billions of dollars.\n","\n","     It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us\n","some new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a\n","Saturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to\n","demonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.\n","\n","     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind\n","us of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\n","senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\n","cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\n","single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. \n","Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\n","little, Test a little.\n","\n","     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\n","didn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change\n","every few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\n","ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\n","known as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn't spend a\n","lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's the\n","last time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn't\n","take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n","18 months.

It was the religion of the great Persian\n","Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ\n","was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three\n","Zoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,\n","Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the\n","Zoroastrian prophet.\n","\n","   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are \n","a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a\n","people is very much on their minds.\n","\n","   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance\n","of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed\n","by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause\n","their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.\n","\n","   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they\n","actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children\n","become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than\n","the world at large - who will be the losers.\n","\n","   \"It's important to have an identity,\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,\n","a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \"It's important\n","for everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.\n","You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.\n","You can fall back on your own identity.\"\n","\n","   For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.\n","\n","   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which\n","animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was\n","only one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which\n","translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.\n","\n","_Good vs. evil_\n","\n","   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with\n","the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for\n","good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences\n","such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,\n","kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of\n","men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.\n","\n","   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to\n","follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,\n","Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,\n","traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.\n","\n","   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a\n","stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of\n","Mount Hamilton, is \"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\"\n","\n","   So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,\n","where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape\n","persecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;\n","the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.\n","\n","   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India\n","and Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from\n","Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state\n","where others had no rights.\n","\n","   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \"good\n","deeds\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,\n","the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because\n","Manou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up\n","downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's\n","dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the\n","Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\n","\n","   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an\n","Iranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples\n","in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount\n","Hamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,\n","and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on\n","this continent.\n","\n","   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the\n","property already had a large house that they have converted to a\n","community center.\n","\n","   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet \n","Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted \n","ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.\n","\n","   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-\n","in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are \n","sometimes called \"fire worshippers,\" they actually consider fire just \n","a symbol of God.  \"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the \n","cross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\" Bhujwala said.\n","\n","   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all\n","Iranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of\n","the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With\n","Zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious\n","and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the\n","United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.\n","\n","  For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people\n","came to worship and revel.\n","\n","   \"The good things in life are not forbidden,\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,\n","a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed\n","proved him right.\n","\n","   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood\n","around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted\n","thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking\n","sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit\n","and nuts.\n","\n","   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \"People eat the\n","fruit,\" Tarapore said.  \"It's a way to participate in the ceremony.\"\n","\n","_Santa Claus, sort of_\n","\n","   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white\n","hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green\n","symbolic of spring) and red.\n","\n","   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and\n","played a tambourine.\n","\n","   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \"This is all new for us, too,\"\n","one told a visitor who asked what was going on.\n","\n","   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with\n","the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have\n","no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their\n","centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu\n","king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his\n","people's religion.\n","\n","   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the\n","San Jose temple whenever he can.\n","\n","   \"When I first heard about this religion,\" he said, \"I thought, my God,\n","this is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.\n","\n","   \"People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the\n","difference with the lower animals?\"\n","\n","Jesus certainly demonstrated the great depth of his love for the\n","children who died today at the Davidian complex.\n","\n","Sorry, but the events today made me even more negative concering\n","organized religion.\n","\n","Cheers,\n","Kent\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Phil> Didn't one of the early jet fighters have these?
